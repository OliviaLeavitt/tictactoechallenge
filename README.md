# Tic-Tac-Toe Challenge

## Overview

This repository contains my solution for the Tic-Tac-Toe programming challenge. The challenge involved creating a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game where the user plays against the computer. The game is implemented in Python and is designed to be run from the command line.

## Installation

To set up and run the Tic-Tac-Toe game, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tictactoechallenge.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd tictactoechallenge
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

    Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries with:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To start the game, use the following command:
```bash
python tictactoe.py


Follow the on-screen prompts to play the game. You will be asked to enter your move by specifying a row and column. The computer will make its move automatically.

Features
User vs. Computer: Play against an AI that attempts to block your winning moves and makes random moves otherwise.
Console-based Interface: The game board and instructions are displayed in the terminal.

Notes
The game board is displayed in the console.
The computer's strategy includes blocking the user from winning and making random moves when no immediate threat is present.
The game ends when there is a winner or the board is full.

Time Spent
Time spent on the challenge: 3 hours and 30 minutes.
