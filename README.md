# Tic-Tac-Toe Challenge

## Overview

This repository contains my solution for the Tic-Tac-Toe programming challenge. The challenge involved creating a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game where the user plays against the computer. The game is implemented in Python and is designed to be run from the command line.

## Installation

To set up and run the Tic-Tac-Toe game, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tictactoechallenge.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd tictactoechallenge
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

    Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries with:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To start the game, use the following command:

    ```bash
    python tictactoe.py
    ```

Follow the on-screen prompts to play the game. You will be asked to enter your move by specifying a row and column. The computer will make its move automatically.

## Features

- **User vs. Computer**: Play against a computer that attempts to block your winning moves and makes random moves otherwise.
- **Console-based Interface**: The game board and instructions are displayed in the terminal.

## Notes

- The game board is displayed in the console.
- The computer's strategy includes blocking the user from winning and making random moves when no immediate threat is present.
- The game ends when there is a winner or the board is full.

## Time Spent

Time spent on the challenge: 3 hours and 30 minutes.
